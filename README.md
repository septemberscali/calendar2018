# Calendar for 2018 September

The weirdness of calling the ninth month "Seventh Month" didn't appear to trouble Old English speakers. September came into Old English from Old French, supplanting the Old English structures, Hāligmōnað and Hærfestmōnað, which signify "gather month" in Modern English. 

On the off chance that the Roman senate had gotten their direction, we may now call September Tiberius or Antoninus, after two Roman Emperors. Or on the other hand we may have wound up calling September Augustus as adherents of the Emperor Commodus trusted, or Germanicus, as Emperor Domitian needed.
